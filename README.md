Hosts Resume' information along with a serach feature for searching Resume's


This is a project I did for a class which was meant to give practice of doing spike exercises in a lean agile process.

I choose to do a project in which I would get to use the MEAN stack as I am very interested in this new web stack.

This project uses the mean.js project template

This project is currently being hosted at http://ancient-thicket-7858.herokuapp.com/#!/
but may be taken down in the near future..
